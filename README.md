# CircleClass

Determining π Experimentally:

Recall that π is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
diameter and that we can calculate the area of a circle with the
formula A=πr2. Below is a circle enscribed within the unit square.

What is the ratio of the areas of the enscribed circle to that of
the unit square?

If we pick a random point within the unit square what is the
probability that the point will also lie within the circle?

If we repeat this experiment an arbitrarily large number of times the
ratio of the number of points which lie within the circle to the number
of points within the unit square (all of them) will approach π/4.

Using the language structures we have discussed write a program that
will do the above experiment an arbitary (determined at run-time)
number of times and report back the approximate value of π.
